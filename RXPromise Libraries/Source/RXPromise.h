## Concurrency:
 
 RXPromises are itself thread safe and will not dead lock. It's safe to send them 
 messages from any thread/queue and at any time.
 
 The handlers use an /e execution-context" where they are executed. The execution
 context is either explicit or implicit. If the execution context is nil or not 
 specified, the handler will execute on a concurrent dispatch queue. Otherwise, 
 the execution context can be specified with the `thenOn` property and can be a 
 dispatch_queue, a NSThread, a NSOperationQueue or a NSManagedObjectContext.
 
 If the \p then propertie's block will be used to define the completion and error
 handler, the handlers will implictily run on an _unspecified_ and _concurrent_
 execution context. That is, once the promise is resolved the corresponding 
 handler MAY execute on any thread and concurrently to any other handler.
 
 If the \p thenOn propertie's block will be used to define completion and error handler,
 the execution context will be explicitly defined through the first parameter 
 _queue_ of the block, which is either a serial or concurrent _dispatch queue_.
 Once the promise is resolved, the handler is guaranteed to execute on the specified
 execution context. The execution context MAY be serial or concurrent.

 Without any other synchronization means, concurrent access to shared resources 
 from within handlers is only guaranteed to be safe when they execute on the same
 and _serial_ execution context.
 
 The "execution context" for a dispatch queue is the target queue of that queue.
 The target queue is responsible for processing the completion or error block.
 
 
 It's safe to specify the same execution context where the \p then or \p thenOn 
 property will be executed.
 
 
 
## Usage:
 

### An example for continuation:
 
    [self fetchUsersWithURL:url]
    .then(^id(id usersJSON){
        return [foo parseJSON:usersJSON];
     }, nil)
    .then(^id(id users){
        return [self mergeIntoMOC:users];
    }, nil)
    .thenOn(dispatch_get_main_queue(), nil,
    ^id(NSError* error) {
        // on main thread
        [self alertError:error];
        return nil;
    });
 
 
### Simultaneous Invocations:
   
 
 Perform authentication for a user, if that succeeded, simultaneously load profile
 and messages for that user, parse the JSON and create models.
 
    RXPromise* if_auth = [self.user authenticate];

    if_auth
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self.user loadProfile]; }, nil)
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self parseJSON:result]; }, nil)
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self createProfileModel:result]; }, nil)
    });

    if_auth
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self.user loadMessages]; }, nil)
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self parseJSON:result]; }, nil)
    .then(^id(id result){ return [self createMessagesModel:result]; }, nil)
    });

 @brief A \p RXPromise object represents the eventual result of an asynchronous
 function or method.
 
 A \p RXPromise is a lightweight primitive which helps managing asynchronous patterns
 and make them easier to follow and understand. It also adds a few powerful features
 to asynchronous operations like \a continuation , \a grouping and \a cancellation
 
 
 @par \b Caution:
 
 A promise which has registered one or more handlers will not deallocate unless
 it is resolved and the handlers are executed. This implies that an asynchronous
 result provider MUST eventually resolve its promise.
 
 @par \b Concurrency:
 
 Concurrent access to shared resources is only guaranteed to be safe for accesses
 from within handlers whose promises belong to the same "promise tree".
 
 A "promise tree" is a set of promises which share the same root promise.
 
 
 @remarks Currently, it is guraranteed that concurrent access from within
 any handler from any promise to a shared resource is guaranteed to be safe.
