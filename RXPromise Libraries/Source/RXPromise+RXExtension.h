 @brief Method \c all returns a \p RXPromise object which will be resolved when \a all

 @discussion The returned promise' completion handler (if any) will be called when
 all promises in the array @p promises have been resolved successfully. The parameter 
 @p result of the completion handler will be an array containing the result of each 
 promise from the array @p promises in the corresponding order.
 
 @par The returned promise' error handler (if any) will be called when any promise 
 in the array @p promises has been rejected with the reason of the first failed 
 promise. If any more promises do fail, the reason will be ignored. It is suggested
 to register error handlers
 
 @par If the returned promise will be cancelled or if any promise in the array has 
 been rejected or cancelled, all other promises in the array will remain unaffected.
 If it is desired to cancel promises if any promise within the array failed, it is 
 suggested to do this in the error handler.

 The completion handler's return value MUST NOT be \c nil. This is due the restriction 
 of \c NSArrays which cannot contain \c nil values.

 @brief Method \p any returns a \c RXPromise object which will be resolved when
 \a any promise in the array \p promises is fulfilled or when \a all have been rejected.
 
 @discussion
 If the first promises in the array will be resolved by the underlying task, all 
 others will be unaffected. When it is desired to cancel all other promises it is 
 suggested to do so in the completion respectively the error handler of the returned
 promise.
 
 The @p result parameter of the completion handler of the @p then property of the
 returned promise is the result of the first promise which has been fulfilled.
 
 The @p reason parameter of the error handler of the @p then property of the returned
 promise indicates that none of the promises has been fulfilled.
 
 @par \b Example:@code
 NSArray* promises = @[async(a), async(b), async(c)];
 RXPromise* any = [RXPromise any:promises]
 .then(^id(id result){

/**
 Executes the asynchronous task associated to the receiver as an iOS Background Task.
 
 @discussion The receiver requests background execution time from the system which
 delays suspension of the app up until the receiver will be resolved or cancelled.
 
 Since Apps are given only a limited amount of time to finish background tasks, 
 this time may expire before the task finishes. In this case the receiver's root
 will be cancelled which in turn propagates the cancel event to all children of
 the reciever, including the receiver.
 
 Tasks may want to handle the cancellation in order to execute additional code which
 orderly closes the task. This should not take too long, since by the time the cancel
 handler is called, the app is already very close to its time limit.
 
 @warning Handlers registered on child promises may not be executed when the app 
 is in background.
 
 @param taskName The name to display in the debugger when viewing the background task.
 If you specify \c nil for this parameter, this method generates a name based on the
 name of the calling function or method.
