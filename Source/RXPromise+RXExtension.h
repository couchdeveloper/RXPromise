/**
 @brief Returns a new \p RXPromise object. If \a all promises in the given array 
 \p promises have been \a fulfilled, the returned promise will be fulfilled with 
 an array containing the result of each promise. Otherwise, the returned promise 
 will be rejected with the error reason of the first failing promise in the array.
 
 @discussion If the given array is \c nil or empty, the returned promise will be
 fulfilled with an empty \c NSArray. Otherwise, if all promises have been fulfilled, 
 the returned promise will be fulfilled with an \c NSArray object containing the
 result value of each promise from the given array @p promises in the corresponding 
 order. 
 
 @par If the result of any promise equals `nil` a \c NSNull object will be stored 
 into the result array instead.
 
 @par If the returned promise will be cancelled or if any promise in the array has
 been rejected or cancelled, all other promises in the array will remain unaffected.
 If it is desired to cancel promises if any promise within the array failed, it is
 suggested to do this in the error handler.
 
 @note If more than one promises will be rejected, the error reason of the subsequent
 promises will be ignored. It is suggested to register error handlers in order 
 to track the errors if required.
 
 @param promises A @c NSArray containing promises. It may be empty or \c nil.
 
 @return A new promise whose value is a \c NSArray containing the result of each
 promise, or an empty \c NSArray.

/**
 Executes the asynchronous task associated to the receiver as an iOS Background Task.
 
 @discussion The receiver requests background execution time from the system which
 delays suspension of the app up until the receiver will be resolved or cancelled.
 
 Since Apps are given only a limited amount of time to finish background tasks, 
 this time may expire before the task finishes. In this case the receiver's root
 will be cancelled which in turn propagates the cancel event to all children of
 the reciever, including the receiver.
 
 Tasks may want to handle the cancellation in order to execute additional code which
 orderly closes the task. This should not take too long, since by the time the cancel
 handler is called, the app is already very close to its time limit.
 
 @warning Handlers registered on child promises may not be executed when the app 
 is in background.
 
 @param taskName The name to display in the debugger when viewing the background task.
 If you specify \c nil for this parameter, this method generates a name based on the
 name of the calling function or method.
